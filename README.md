# Why Download the Internet When You Can Embed It?

Being able to query the data sources for relevancy without re-embedding will keep the internet and have less walled gardens. Open Embeddings is a project to create a standardized way for Creators / Publishers to expose their content in an AI-native way, without end-users in an embedding model agnostic way.

## What does success look like?

* Content Providers pay less in publishing costs to expose their content to AI systems.
* Developers can easily access high-quality embeddings for content without the need to re-embed
* End Users can "collect" embeddings without needing to worry about which model or platform they are using, allowing for a more seamless experience across different AI systems.

## How do we plan to accomplish this?
Define a communication format for new file(s) to be included on every website called 'open embeddings'.  This website exists to create a place to define that format.


### Problem Statement 1:
 I want to search for videos related to my personal minecraft playing style but do not want to download every video on the internet. Embeddings allow me to search for videos related to minecraft without downloading every video on the internet. Open Embeddings will allow developers, content creators, and AI platforms to interact with their content embeddings in a standardized way.

### Problem Statement 2:
Content publishers need an AI native way to expose contents to Agentic systems. Content publishers can expose multiple sets of embedding for the same content at a lower aggregate bandwidth than the original content while still allow AI systems to interact and add value for users.

-  Until recent research work has demonstrated concrete steps to the contrary, Proprietary Models have tended to "lock up" content that requires re-embedding to allow finding similarities. The cost of transforming across embedding spaces should be lower than the cost of re-embedding content at scale.  See https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2

## Target End-User:
Developers, Content Creators, AI platforms
