# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. Why should the publisher pay?
    - Publishers benefit from reduced costs in bandwidth, compute, and storage by exposing their content in an AI-native format. Everyone benefits as they don't have to do the encoding, saving precious GPUs for other inference activities.

1. Is this vaporware?
    - No, this is not vaporware. This is a real project with a real specification and real use cases. We are actively working on it and welcome contributions from the community.

1. What about dynamic content?
  From a publisher perspective, dynamic content has a URI / lifespan and we definitely want to advertise that the underlying content behind the embeddings may have changed.
