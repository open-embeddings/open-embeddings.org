# Open Embeddings

**Content Embeddings are the search pathway for the open internet of AI.**

A standardized way to expose content embeddings will allow developers, content creators to make their data queryable without downloading the actual content.

## The Problem

**Problem 1:** I want to search for videos related to minecraft but do not want to download every video on the internet. Embeddings allow me to search for videos related to minecraft without downloading every video on the internet.

**Problem 2:** Content publishers need an AI native way to expose contents to Agentic systems. Content publishers can expose multiple sets of embedding for the same content at a lower aggregate bandwidth than the original content while still allow AI systems to interact and add value for users.

## Our Solution

Open Embeddings will allow developers, content creators, and AI platforms to expose their content embeddings in a standardized way through a simple JSON file format.

## Value Proposition

- **Developers:** Easier access to high-quality embeddings for content without re-embedding costs
- **Content Creators:** Greater control over how their content is interpreted and used by AI, with the ability to expose multiple sets of embeddings  
- **AI Platforms:** A standardized way to ingest and understand web content, reducing the need for re-embedding and allowing for more efficient content discovery and delivery

## Get Involved

We encourage community participation through multiple channels:

*   **[Read the Draft RFC](rfc.html)** - Review and comment on the technical specification
*   **[See Examples](examples.html)** - Explore sample implementations and use cases
*   **[Provide Feedback](feedback.html)** - Share your thoughts and suggestions
