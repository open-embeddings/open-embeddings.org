# Open Embeddings RFC - Draft Specification

*This is a living document. We encourage community feedback and contributions through pull requests and issues.*

## Abstract

Given the rate of change of machine-learning, no one person can have all the answers. We are seeking to find a format that most people can embrace while honoring dissenting opinions. Scripts/Agents can have a defined upgrade path.

Please go to the main RFC here:
[RFC Document - Coming Soon](rfc/)

*The detailed RFC specification is currently being drafted. Check back soon for the complete technical specification.*
