# Project Charter & Roadmap

## Mission Statement

**Open Embeddings aims to create a sustainable, standardized way to lower the barrier to entry for new AI agents, scripts, and services while reducing the pressure on content providers from repeated re-embedding operations across multiple models.**

## Vision

We envision an internet where content discovery is AI-native by default, where:
- Content providers can expose their material efficiently without bandwidth waste
- Developers can build semantic search applications without re-embedding costs
- End users can discover relevant content across platforms and models seamlessly
- The open internet remains accessible and avoids capture behind walled gardens

## Project Goals

### When you leave this presentation, you will hopefully understand the thesis and some of you will further:

1. **Define a great Open Format / Spec** for content-providers to leverage multiple models
2. **Update commonly used content publishing tools** to support the format securely  
3. **Generate a corpus of distributed cross-space materials** to allow transitions between closed models and open model encoded data

## Organizational Structure

### Non-Profit Foundation
- Run as a non-profit organization funded through donations and open-source grants
- Best-in-class administrative fee structure for any paid work
- Community volunteer-driven development for core functionality
- Seek partnerships with organizations sharing our vision of an open, accessible internet

### Target Partners
- **Mozilla and Google** - Initial outreach for website and RFC development support
- **Tech companies** committed to open standards
- **Educational institutions** researching AI and semantic web technologies  
- **Non-profits** focused on open-source software and AI ethics

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2024)
**Status: In Progress**

- [x] Define core problem statement and solution approach
- [x] Create project documentation and website
- [x] Draft initial RFC specification  
- [ ] Build reference parsers in Python and JavaScript
- [ ] Establish community feedback channels
- [ ] Create validation tools and testing frameworks

**Success Metrics:**
- RFC draft complete and published
- Reference implementations available
- Community engagement initiated

### Phase 2: Adoption (Q2-Q3 2024)
**Status: Planning**

- [ ] Integrate with popular CMS platforms (WordPress, Drupal, Jekyll)
- [ ] Partner with content creators for pilot implementations
- [ ] Develop browser extensions and developer tools
- [ ] Create interactive demos and educational content
- [ ] Submit to standards bodies for formal review

**Success Metrics:**
- 10+ websites implementing Open Embeddings
- CMS plugin ecosystem established
- Standards body engagement initiated

### Phase 3: Scale (Q4 2024)
**Status: Future**

- [ ] Address hard implementation problems (model sprawl, cache invalidation)
- [ ] Research cross-model embedding transformation frameworks
- [ ] Develop enterprise-grade security and performance features
- [ ] Create distributed embedding network protocols
- [ ] Establish certification and compliance programs

**Success Metrics:**
- 100+ websites using Open Embeddings
- Academic research partnerships established
- Industry adoption by major platforms

## Technical Priorities

### Hard Implementation Problems

1. **Model Sprawl**
   - Research recent academic work on embedding space transformations
   - Develop framework for multi-modal model compatibility
   - Create standardized APIs for model conversion

2. **Cache-Invalidation** 
   - Design trust mechanisms for embedding freshness
   - Implement content change detection systems
   - Develop distributed validation networks

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Compression algorithms for embedding vectors
   - Pagination strategies for large content sets
   - CDN integration and caching strategies

4. **Security & Privacy**
   - Prevent sensitive information leakage in embeddings
   - Access control mechanisms for private content
   - Audit trails and compliance monitoring

## Community Engagement

### Call to Action Hooks

- **Participate on draft spec** - Review and contribute to RFC development
- **Build POCs** - Create proof-of-concept implementations
- **Share your use cases** - Help us understand real-world requirements  
- **Contribute to the project** - Join development, documentation, or outreach efforts

### Competitive Landscape

Currently, no other known groups are pushing in this direction. Our strategy:
- **Encourage collaboration** - Invite similar initiatives to join forces
- **Open development** - Transparent, community-driven specification process
- **Broad participation** - Welcome input from all stakeholders

## Sustainability Model

### Funding Sources
- Individual donations from community members
- Open-source grants from foundations and tech companies
- Partnership agreements with aligned organizations
- Revenue from optional certification and compliance services

### Cost Management
- Volunteer-driven core development
- Minimal infrastructure costs (static site hosting, basic tooling)
- Community-contributed documentation and examples
- Grant funding for major development initiatives

## Success Indicators

### Short-term (6 months)
- RFC specification stabilized and published
- Reference implementations available and tested
- Active community of 50+ contributors and users
- Partnership agreements with 2+ major organizations

### Medium-term (1 year) 
- 100+ websites implementing Open Embeddings
- Integration with major CMS platforms
- Academic research partnerships established
- Standards body submission completed

### Long-term (2+ years)
- Widespread adoption across the web
- Reduction in content re-embedding costs industry-wide
- Thriving ecosystem of tools and services
- Measurable impact on open internet accessibility
